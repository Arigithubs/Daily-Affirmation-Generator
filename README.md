# Daily Affirmation Generator

Welcome to the Daily Affirmation Generator project! This web application provides users with a daily positive affirmation to promote a positive mindset and self-reflection.

## Features

- Generates a random affirmation with the click of a button.
- Clean and user-friendly interface.
- Responsive design for various devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## JavaScript Logic Explanation

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains the logic for generating a random affirmation from a predefined list. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### Affirmations Array

The `affirmations` array holds positive statements that the generator randomly selects. You can customize this array with your own affirmations.

```javascript
const affirmations = [
    "Today, I am filled with gratitude.",
    "I attract positivity and abundance into my life.",
    // Add more affirmations as needed
];
```

### `generateRandomAffirmation` Function

This function generates a random index within the range of the affirmations array and sets the text content of the HTML element (`affirmationText`) to the randomly selected affirmation. Additionally, it temporarily disables the button after a click to prevent rapid clicks, providing a better user experience.

```javascript
function generateRandomAffirmation() {
    generateAffirmationButton.disabled = true;
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * affirmations.length);
    affirmationText.textContent = affirmations[randomIndex];
    setTimeout(function () {
        generateAffirmationButton.disabled = false;
    }, 1000);
}
```

### Event Listener

The "Generate Affirmation" button has an event listener that triggers the `generateRandomAffirmation` function when clicked.

```javascript
generateAffirmationButton.addEventListener('click', generateRandomAffirmation);
```

### Initial Generation

An initial affirmation is generated when the page loads.

```javascript
generateRandomAffirmation();
```
